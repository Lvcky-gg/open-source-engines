# Contribution guidelines

* First and most importantly those are my personal bookmarks and I will add a submitted engine only if it seems interesting to me. If you disagree feel free to fork the repository.

* Make sure that the submitted engine is not already included in the list.

* Place the title in the appropriate section or make a new section if appropriate.

* Keep resource titles and section titles in lexicographic order.

* The pull request needs to have a descriptive title.

* Make a separate pull request for each of the engines.

* Use the format `**[Engine Name](link_to_the_engine_website)** - Short description. [[source]](link_to_the_source_repository)`.

* Do not include trailing `/` character from the URL.

* Write a [good](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit) commit message.
